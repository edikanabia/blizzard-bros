    em "Are you ready? This will hurt for a moment, but the relief will come after."
    wb "Rrggh—! Khhhh…"
    em "Easy, easy… Again, this is still just warm water, but given your body temperature…"
    em "This will melt the ice formations, but the wounds they were causing will open up when they do."
    "The strange werebeast growls lowly. His teeth glint in the light of my lantern. I pay little mind as I continue talking through my work."

    em "I’ll be dressing the wounds now. Your body temperature means blood will not flow as freely…" 
    em "which is the opposite of what we want, given we want the healing process to go by as quickly as possible." 
    em "As such, I’ll prepare these dressings to provide some warmth to the areas, amongst other things to promote healing."
    "It’s quick, simple work. I almost find it meditative."
    "I hadn’t noticed when he stopped growling at me, but when I do, I notice that he has been watching me as well. With curiosity, caution, or some other underlying emotion, I couldn’t tell."
    "Either way, I pretend that I don’t see him watching me. The moment I move to look up at him, he then quickly looks away—which is just about the reaction I expected." 
    "He doesn’t seem skittish; just guarded. I try to give him a warm smile, though this prompts no reaction."
    em "There, we’re finished. And here, you can use this. The magic on this should last for quite a long time."
    "I drape a heated blanket over him."
    em "Now, would you care to join me for dinner? It’s not much, but it should suffice for a meal."
    wb "…"
    em "Come now, weren’t you just threatening to eat me earlier? Surely you’re starving. I have enough for the both of us."
    "The werebeast cranes his head and watches me open up some containers from my bag."
    wb "…Ice cubes, Good Doctor?"
    em "Concentrated soup, it keeps well in this weather. Now, would you like to join me?"
    "I melt down more fresh snow in the kettle. The werebeast seems interested as I use magic to heat it up."

    wb "What are you using as a conduit? Yourself?"
    em "Ah— the gloves, actually. It’s quite the rage these days. The material is like leather, but made to handle the duress of casting magic."
    wb "...Hm."
    "The werebeast takes a hold of one of my hands, inspecting the glove. I nearly drop the kettle in surprise, but I don’t resist or pull back. There’s a certain interest to his gaze that I can’t discern, but at the very least, I can tell he means no harm."
    "However, he only looks for a short moment before he lets go."
    wb "...Never mind. You can still sense traces of magic from it."
    em "Ah? What do you mean?"
    wb "It’s nothing. I wanted to know if it was any different from a regular magical conduit."
    em "Oh, no. The only real difference is aesthetics."
    wb "A shame."
    em "..."
    "The conversation lulls into an awkward silence, and I find myself observing him for the rest of our dinner."
    "Much of the ice formations on his body were melted away from earlier; ones that were causing open sores and wounds, giving him active pain whenever he moved."
    "Living in a cold climate such as this place likely isn’t helping either, extra warmth might lessen the severeity of the formations. I’ve given him a heated blanket for this reason, though it can’t cover him entirely, given how large he is."
    "This, along with his physical form in general, clearly suggests curse magic. However lycanthropic and elemental bane curses are typically separate..."
    "And lycanthropic is the closest that his form resembles, though theres a certain ambiguity to it that I cant confidently diagnose it as such."
    "It’s likely theres a cocktail of curses afflicting him, though how and why, I’m not sure."
    "Once we finish up dinner, I clean up and rise to my feet."
    em "I’ll be retiring for the night. I’ll leave you alone and then check on you in the morning."
    "The werebeast makes no indication that he heard me, but I assume he did anyway."
    em "Have a good night."
    "I make my way back up the stairs, and out of the basement. It shouldn’t take long to find a fireplace, or at least I hope so."

    "Biting cold is the first thing I feel when I wake up. Unsurprisingly, the fire died down overnight. I rub my face, clearing the bleariness from my eyes. It is only then I see the documents strewn about around me."
    "Not an unfamiliar situation to wake up to, but the location certainly is unique."

    "The blizzard still rages on, I can tell that much from the window. Not much else to discern. I can barely see my van through the haze."
    "I’m still good on supplies for another day or so, so my only hope is that the blizzard subsides by then."
    "For now, I suppose there’s not much else to do besides check on the werebeast. He should be fine, but there’s much I would like to ask him."

    em "Good morning. Would you care to join me for breakfast?"
    "The werebeast stirs, and turns to look at me."
    wb "You’re persistent."
    em "Ha, you could call it that. You are also the only company I have while I am here."
    wb "Fair enough. I can’t say I’ll be good company."
    em "Good enough for me. Now, breakfast?"
    "We eat breakfast in silence, though it’s not an uncomfortable one."
    "However, once I finish cleaning up, only then does the werebeast speak up."
    wb "I did kill all of the other prisoners down here, if that’s what you were wondering."
    "I was taken aback, mostly due to how unprompted the confession was."
    em "I—"
    wb "Does that satisfy your question?"
    em "Not exactly. Mind elaborating?"
    wb "We realized pretty quickly that the estate was abandoned when no one came down to feed us. We couldn’t escape either, since the magic keeping the prisons locked was still pretty strong."
    wb "So everyone started getting worried about how they were going to survive. You should have seen how quick they were willing to turn to cannibalism. It was disgusting."
    wb "Anyway, I ate all of them. It’s not like I wasn’t getting hungry myself. I couldn’t stand another minute with any of them, and I didn’t want them to stick around long enough that I started to pity them."
    em "You speak about them with contempt. You must despise these people."
    wb "Hah. That’s an understatement."
    wb "I found a perverse enjoyment in watching them suffer."
    wb "They were vile people. I wasn’t their only victim, but I took the worst of it because I fought back."
    wb "I could never fit into the mould they were trying to shape me into. I’m glad they met the end that they had."
    em "…"
    em "You were the one to curse all of them, were you?"
    wb "Quick on the uptake. Yes, I was. That’s why I’m like this as well."
    "Magic lingers from where it is cast. As it goes, it’s wise to use some other object to channel magic through, rather than channeling the magic through one’s own body." 
    "A horror story children would be told when they first start learning magic is when a man died from essentially cooking himself alive from frequently using fire magic from his hands and mouth."
    "This would explain the cocktail nature of the werebeast’s curse, and why the conditions of how it works are not so clear-cut. The lingering magic from cursing every person eventually built up to be its own fully fledged curse, rather than be some minor inconvenience."
    em "Why didn’t you use a conduit? You don’t seem the type to use magic in such a risky way without reason."
    wb "You know that it’s easy to trace magic from its source. Much like the ballistics of a gun."
    wb "I learned it’s much harder to trace when you use your own body to channel magic."
    wb "It worked, didn’t it? They never did figure out who was behind all of the cursings."
    em "That’s…novel."
    wb "You’d be surprised how many ideas you get from listening to the radio. I wasn’t allowed to listen to it when I was younger, but I snuck one in my room, and I would listen to it when I had the chance."
    em "You weren’t allowed the radio?"
    wb "I wasn’t allowed many things, Good Doctor. Even as an adult I could not act as my own person."
    wb "The only time I was allowed to leave the house was to meet with a man who fancied me, arranged by my parents."
    wb "I cursed him too, by the way."
    "I continued to urge him to talk about his past life, and he spoke about it with nothing but disdain and contempt."
    "I begin to realize that his actions were one of desperation, and an attempt to sieze control of his life."
    "I pour him a cup of tea I had prepared while we were talking, and he holds it awkwardly in his large claws."
    em "I have one more thing to ask."
    wb "Not like I can object."
    em "You can. I am being quite nosy after all. However you seem eager to tell your story."
    wb "...Anyway, what did you want to ask?"
    em "Why haven’t you left this place? As you can see, the magic locking this prison has long since faded. You are free to leave whenever you want. You could sieze the life you always wanted."
    wb "As horrid of a life mine has been, my actions aren’t completely excusable. There’s no better fate for me than to rot in this cell."
    wb "It’s not like I have anywhere else to go, nor do I have any aspirations that are feasible for me."
    wb "I have nothing here. I have less out there."
    "The werebeast pours himself another cup of tea. The thought leaves my mouth faster than I can think on it."
    em "Why not come travel with me?"
    "As impulsive as the offer was, it was one I was welcoming of. For the first time during this stay, the Werebeast is astonished, and it takes him a moment to respond."
    wb "What?"
    em "I am a traveling doctor. I do have one other person that will soon travel with me, however neither of us would mind an additional companion to join us. We have the means to support an extra occupant or two."
    em "If you wanted a fresh start with no one to judge you, why not in a strange land with some strangers?"
    wb "How...bold."
    wb "And dangerous. You know what I’ve done. What makes you think I wont stop at just that?"
    em "Have I done anything to draw your ire?"
    wb "What if you will? I could leave my past behind, but if youre here, wouldn’t it be important to consider how I could harm you?"
    em "Maybe so. But it has been quite some time. You can take this as an opportunity to be someone beyond their agony and vengence. You could be your own person."
    "The werebeast doesn’t respond. He puts down his cup, and I collect it from him."
    em "I’ll give you time to consider the idea. You’re not obligated to choose one way or another, and I would be fine with whatever you decide."
    "I stand up and ascend the stairs."
    em "I will return in the evening to check up on your wounds. My hope is that theyre healing fine."
