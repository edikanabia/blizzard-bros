em "Are you ready? This will hurt for a moment, but the relief will come after."

"Werebeast" "Rrggh—! Khhhh…"

"Emmett" "Easy, easy… Again, this is still just warm water, but given your body temperature…"

"Emmett" "This will melt the ice formations, but the wounds they were causing will open up when they do."

"The strange werebeast growls lowly. His teeth glint in the light of my lantern. I pay little mind as I continue talking through my work." 

"Emmett" "I’ll be dressing the wounds now. Your body temperature means blood will not flow as freely… which is the opposite of what we want, given we want the healing process to go by as quickly as possible." 

"Emmett" "As such, I’ll prepare these dressings to provide some warmth to the areas, amongst other things to promote healing."

"It’s quick, simple work. I almost find it meditative."

"I hadn’t noticed when he stopped growling at me, but when I do, I notice that he has been watching me as well. With curiosity, caution, or some other underlying emotion, I couldn’t tell."

"Either way, I pretend that I don’t see him watching me. The moment I move to look up at him, he then quickly looks away—which is just about the reaction I expected. He doesn’t seem skittish; just guarded. I try to give him a warm smile, though this prompts no reaction."

"Emmett" "There, we’re finished. And here, you can use this. The magic on this should last for quite a long time."

"I drape a heated blanket over him— however"

"Emmett" "Now, would you care to join me for dinner? It’s not much, but it should suffice for a meal."

"Werebeast" "…"

"Emmett" "Come now, weren’t you just threatening to eat me earlier? Surely you’re starving. I have enough for the both of us."

"The werebeast cranes his head and watches me open up some containers from my bag."

"Werebeast" "…Ice cubes, Good Doctor?"

"Emmett" "Concentrated soup, it keeps well in this weather. Now, would you like to join me?"

"I melt down more fresh snow in the kettle. The werebeast seems interested as I use magic to heat it up."

"Werebeast" "What are you using as a conduit? Yourself?"

"Emmett" "Ah— the gloves, actually. It’s quite the rage these days. The material is like leather, but made to handle the duress of casting magic."

# second scene

“Hopefully this will not be the last time I am able to write. I am done working for this family. I did not come to this conclusion lightly, as I have worked for them for Lord knows how long. Frankly, I regret not leaving when the child was infected… but I stayed out of loyalty to him, as I had seen him grow up. Probably a bit naive in hindsight. I stayed and tried to help but instead watched everyone turn. You can’t even call this a plague, this is- something else.”

"Hm, it seems like a curse went around this mansion. But what was the cause of it?"

Emmett switches over to read a list of names, hastily scribbled on a sheet of paper. They are each labeled with the different rooms in the house. 

"So it wasn’t just the family but it looks like the mansion staff were cursed too…"

“When word got out that the child turned, about half of the staff dropped overnight. The kitchen was a mess. My comrades wrapped any food that they could carry on their backs in spare linens from the washroom-”

The bottom of the entry has been eaten by moths, lost to time.

"I was right! They did look like they left in a hurry. But there’s still a lot that’s not fitting here."

Emmett looks at another letter he found which was near the front door of the mansion. He cracks open the wax seal and unfolds it.

“Leave now. There was a reason why those who turned were left behind.”

"…he was abandoned?"

he notes that the cursed were “hidden away” into the basement he was just in, and that there were several skeletons and corpses littered around the prisons. the only one that is still alive is the werebeast that he had just treated. [I just copied this straight from the outline; will this be a cutscene or something that Emmett pieces together from the artifacts he collected?] something he pieces together 👍 falo being the only one alive is an observation that he takes note of 

Emmett looks over at the werebeast sound asleep in the corner.

"Well, it looks like he has a lot of explaining to do tomorrow!"

# final scene

"Morning rises once more, and blessedly, I still haven’t succumbed to the cold. Better yet…"

"Emmett" "…It’s quiet."

"Indeed, the fireplace is reduced to dying embers. The house no longer groans against the force of the wind. In fact, there is no howling wind at all."

# CG of window view

"A look out the window ties it all together."

"With the blizzard gone, my van is in clear view. A little buried, but nothing a little menial labor and fire magic couldn’t fix."

"Emmett" "Before that, I should prepare breakfast."

"Emmett" "Now, where did I put my kettle…"

"The door to the cellar creaks open behind me. I turn to look—"

"—and I see a haggard individual with overgrown hair and a tattered cloak, threadbare from the stresses of transforming. They hold out my kettle in their bandaged hand, and the heated blanket over their forearm."

"Werebeast?" "You forgot these."

"Emmett" "Ah! Thank you. You can keep the blanket, though. You’ll need it more than I do."

"Werebeast?" "About that…"

"Werebeast?" "I made up my mind. You said you wouldn’t mind an extra traveling companion, right?"

"Werebeast?" "I’ll be joining you. I hope you didn’t plan on turning back on your offer."

"Emmett" "Of course not. I was hoping you would accept, actually."

"I prepare breakfast for the both of us, and I thank the heavens once more that the blizzard had subsided—these were the last meal packs I had on hand."

"Emmett" "There’s a shower installed inside the van—you’re free to use it once we clear the van of snow. We’ll then make our way back towards the nearest town, if that’s alright."

"Werebeast?" "No one will know who I am over there, it’s fine."

"Werebeast?" "If you need some extra money, I kept a secret stash in my room. I had it in case I found the chance to escape from this place, so…"

"Werebeast?" "I guess now’s a good time to dip into it."

"Emmett" "Well…How about we go to a barbershop once we’re in town? A change in appearance might be refreshing."

"Werebeast?" "I’d like that."

"He cracks a weary, faint smile."

"Werebeast?" "By the way, you never told me your name."

"Emmett" "Ah, of course. My name is Emmett. You never told me yours, either."

"Falo" "Falo."

"Falo" "I always liked the name, so you can call me that."

"Emmett" "Well met, Falo."
